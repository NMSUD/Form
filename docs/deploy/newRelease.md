# New Release

When creating a new release, there are a few things to remember

- Change the version number in the `package.json` file
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with all the changes
  - Add new link to the bottom of the file
- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/NMSUD/Form/compare/main...develop) in the Github Repo

> TODO update this page after a few more releases...
