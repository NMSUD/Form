# What is Form

Form is _(a bad name for this solution but is mainly)_ a custom solution to accepting submissions from [No Man's Sky][nomanssky] players for the [Unification Day][nmsudWebsite] event.

## Why?

In past [Unification Day][nmsudWebsite] events, there were a huge amount of submissions which were sent as [Discord][discord] messages. This created a lot of work for the organisers of the [NMSUD][nmsudWebsite].

We wanted to prevent the same scenario from happening again this year (2024). We (the NMSUD organisers) quickly identified that automation could save us a lot of effort and provide a smoother experience for players. 

## Goals for the project

Our primary goal is to **make submissions easier for users**. While we want to automate as much as possible, we cannot expect users to jump through many hoops just to give us data.
