          Due to the success of the previous events (especially 2023), there were a huge amount of
          submissions. The submissions had to be handled manually, which included gathering more
          information on submissions, updating of the <NMSUDHomeLink /> website, planning the
          event's schedule and more. This consumed a large amount of time and effort for the small
          NMSUD organisers group.

          For this year, the <NMSUDHomeLink /> has developed a system that should make it easy for
          players to submit their builds easily, provide a way for more <NMSUDHomeLink /> organisers
          to participate in managing the submissions from players and automate a lot of processes
          that were manual. abillities from <AssistantNmsHomeLink />
          &nbsp; we were able to build this tool.

                This was because the tool was still under construction and required a lot of
                testing. Invalid pet JSON can easily break NMS saves. We did our best to ensure that
                the tool will be safe for everyone to use.
