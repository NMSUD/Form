# Form components

These components are used in the `formBuilder.tsx` to render easy to use components for users to enter data with validation. A form component has a few requirements in order to work in the forms, they should make use of the `FormInputProps<T>` interface where T is the type of the property. For example a text input form component would have props of type `FormInputProps<string>`.

## FormInput

Below is what the `FormInputProps` looks like (at the time of writing, this will likely fall out of date quickly ðŸ˜…).

```ts
export type FormInputProps<T> = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  helpText?: string;
  value: T;
  placeholder: string;
  showValidationMessages: boolean;
  validation: (val: T) => ValidationResult;
  onChange: (newValue: T) => void;
};
```

You can see some basics, such as a value property and an onChange function.

## Extending FormInput

If there are additional properties that your component needs, you can specify them like this:

```ts
interface IFormLongInputProps extends FormInputProps<string> {
  inputType?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```
