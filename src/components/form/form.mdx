# Form components

These components are used in the `formBuilder.tsx` to render easy to use components for users to enter data with validation. A form component has a few requirements in order to work in the forms, they should make use of the `IFormInputProps<T>` interface where T is the type of the property. For example a text input form component would have props of type `IFormInputProps<string>`.

## IFormInput

Below is what the `IFormInputProps` looks like (at the time of writing, this will likely fall out of date quickly ðŸ˜…).

```ts
export type IFormInputProps<T> = {
    id: string;
    label: string;
    helpText: string;
    value: T;
    placeholder: string;
    showValidationMessages: boolean;
    validation: (val: T) => ValidationResult;
    onChange: (newValue: T) => void;
};
``` 

You can see some basics, such as a value property and an onChange function.

## Extending IFormInput

If there are additional properties that your component needs, you can specify them like this:

```ts
interface IFormLongInputProps extends IFormInputProps<string> {
    inputType?: string;
    disabled?: boolean;
}
```
