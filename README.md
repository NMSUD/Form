## üì¶ Projects in this repo

### Website

This is the website that contains the forms that users will see. It allows for user inputs, with validation and knows how to package all the information to be sent to the API.

### API

This is able to accept requests, prevent spam, unpack and verify the contents and ultimately securely store the information in a database.

### Data generator

This script is able to pull all the uploaded images and the records out of the database. Then the script manipulates and writes the data to json files to be consumed by websites, apps, etc later.
