## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome the disclosure of any security vulnerabilities found through a [Github Security advisory][githubSecurityAdvisory], via our [discord][discord] or via an [email][contactEmail]. You can typically expect a 
response within two business days, and we typically have fixes out in under a week from the initial disclosure.

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
