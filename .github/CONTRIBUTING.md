## What should I know before I get started?

### Project History

This [greenfield project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) was started to solve an issue experienced by the [NMSUD][nmsudWebsite] organisers the previous years (2023 & 2022 primarily). The amount of participants became unmanageable for organisers to both manage incomplete entries posted in discord messages and update the website while managing an ever-changing event schedule.

### Design Decisions

While this project solves quite a simple problem, capturing data for multiple forms with custom input components (e.g. portal glyph input), it is quite difficult to do well. Our main goals are:
- Ease of use
- Automation
- Verify submissions
- Low cost 

## How Can I Contribute?

### I found a bug and want to report it

First of all thank you for taking the time to check our guidelines before creating a Github issue üí™

To help keep the issues manageable, please double check that the issue you have, has not been reported already in the issues list. Secondly please ensure that you fill in as much information as possible on the issue. The issue template should help you through the process, sometimes small details help us find the bug quickly.

### Suggesting a Feature

_**Please note:** Just because a feature ticket exists, does not mean that we will or can build the feature._ 

- Ensure that there is no existing feature request on the [issues page](https://github.com/NMSUD/Form/issues)
- Research is required
  - Typically when a feature is built, there is a lot of time spent gathering the data, figuring out how we are going to make use of and store the data within the apps, figuring out how to localise (translate) the data displayed.
- Some things may not be possible or will take too much time.

You can create a feature request from [here](https://github.com/NMSUD/Form/issues/new?assignees=&labels=idea&template=---feature-request.yaml)
